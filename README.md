# Blackjack Game in C++

This is a command-line implementation of the popular casino card game Blackjack (also known as 21) in C++. The game follows Vegas-style rules and allows you to play multiple hands against the dealer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system to compile and run this program.

### Compiling the Program

To compile the program, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

g++ main.cpp -o blackjack

This will create an executable file named `blackjack` in the current directory.

### Running the Game

After compiling the program, you can run the Blackjack game by executing the `blackjack` executable:

./blackjack

Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. You will be prompted to choose actions like "Hit" or "Stand" during your turn.

### Vegas-style Rules

The game follows the standard Vegas-style rules for Blackjack, including:

- The dealer must hit on a soft 17 (a hand with an Ace counted as 11).
- Aces can be counted as either 1 or 11, depending on the player's hand value.
- The player wins if their hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, or if the dealer busts (goes over 21).
